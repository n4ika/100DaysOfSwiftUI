# 100 Days of SwiftUI

My journey through Paul Hudson's [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) course.

## About This Repository

This repo contains all the projects and challenges I've completed as part of the 100 Days of SwiftUI challenge. Each project folder includes the complete Xcode project along with any personal improvements or modifications I made beyond the original tutorial.

## Projects Completed

### Days 16-18: WeSplit
**A bill splitting app with tip calculator**

- âœ… Basic bill splitting functionality
- âœ… Tip percentage selection
- âœ… Dynamic calculations
- ðŸš€ **Personal Enhancement**: Implemented optional Double and nil-coalescing operators from earlier lessons for better UX - users now see a clean empty field instead of having to clear $0.00

**Key Learning Points:**
- SwiftUI Forms and Sections
- State management with @State
- Focus management with @FocusState
- Picker components
- Currency formatting
